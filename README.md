 Project 3: Linear Regression on Housing Dataset

 Overview
This project deploys and assesses a Linear Regression model to forecast house prices from numerical attributes like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking availability. The dataset is derived from Kaggle and comprises several attributes of residential homes.

 Dataset
- File: `housing.csv`
- Source: Kaggle Housing Price Prediction Dataset

 Features Used
- area
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- stories
- parking

 Target
- price

 Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Picked relevant features and target
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Tested the model with MAE, MSE, and R²
6. Interpreted model coefficients

 Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

 Conclusion
The model assists in grasping how characteristics such as area and number of bathrooms affect the ultimate house price. It may be extended further with feature engineering or polynomial regression.
